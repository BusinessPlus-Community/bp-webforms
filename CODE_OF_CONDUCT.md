# Code of conduct

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: [Latest Version](rr)

## Purpose
In Highline Public Schools, we embrace high expectations for all students in academic achievement and conduct. All of us â€” superintendent and principals, teachers and staff, families and students, the Highline community â€” have a shared responsibility to educate our students. We believe that all students can be successful when they know and understand these expectations.

This document outlines the rights and the responsibilities for all members of the Highline Public Schools community. It serves as a reference for students, families and schools as we work together to ensure the safety of all students and staff and to maintain a positive learning environment.

Together, we can support all of our students so that every student is successful.

## Our Promise
Our Highline Promise is that every student is known by name, strength and need, and graduates prepared for the future they choose.

Eliminating racism, racial inequities, and institutional bias will increase achievement and graduation rates for all students, while narrowing the gaps between the highest and lowest performing students.  Our [strategic plan](strategicPlan) is the districtâ€™s equity plan.
